# Aurora - Geomagnetic Storm Prediction Model 🌌

## Deep Learning Model for Geomagnetic Storm Prediction 🪟

- Conceived and developed during the IITM-HACKOUT Hackathon and refined in subsequent months, this project is our endeavor to predict Geomagnetic Storms with considerable accuracy. The model serves various scientific and industrial purposes while also aiming to educate the public on the fascinating science behind Earth's Geomagnetic Activity.

## About 🔍

This repository houses the source code and resources for our Geomagnetic Storm Prediction Model, named Aurora. The model utilizes deep learning techniques, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), implemented in Jupyter Notebooks with Python. Historical data is processed using JSON formats to achieve accurate predictions.
